    <h2>How to Make Graveyard Cupcakes</h2>
    <div class="lists">
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Cupcakes:</strong> Combine cupcake ingredients according to the recipe instructions, pour the batter into the liners, and bake. Remove them from the tins immediately, then let them cool before frosting.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Ganache:</strong> Make the ganache using the microwave, then let it chill in the refrigerator.</li>
            <li><strong>Frosting:</strong> Mix frosting ingredients until it becomes light and fluffy, then put it into a piping bag and set aside until ready to use.</li>
            <li><strong>Assemble:</strong> Fill the cupcakes with ganache, frost them, and decorate! More tips for making the tombstone decorations can be found in the recipe card.</li>

    <h2>Ingredient Notes</h2>
    <div class="lists">
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Buttermilk:</strong> If you don’t have buttermilk, make your own by measuring ½ cup of milk, removing ½ tablespoon of it, and mixing in ½ tablespoon of lemon juice or white vinegar. Let this mixture sit for 5 minutes before using in the recipe.</li>
            <li><strong>Cocoa powder:</strong> I like to use natural cocoa powder in this recipe, but you can use whatever you have on hand.</li>
            <li><strong>Butter:</strong> You can use salted butter in the cupcakes; simply omit the kosher salt. I do not recommend using salted butter in the frosting.</li>
            <li><strong>Brown sugar:</strong> You can use granulated sugar in place of the brown sugar.</li>
            <li><strong>Chocolate chips:</strong> In the ganache, you can use whatever kind of chocolate chips you like, such as milk or dark. Do NOT use white chocolate chips in place of the Baker’s white chocolate; they will not melt as smoothly.</li>
            <li><strong>Corn syrup:</strong> You can omit the corn syrup, but the ganache will not be as shiny.</li>
            <li><strong>Graham crackers:</strong> In place of the chocolate-coated graham crackers, you can use Vienna fingers, Biscoff cookies, Milanos, or any other tombstone-shaped cookie!

    <h2>Tips for the Best Graveyard Cupcakes</h2>
    <div class="lists">
        <ul>
            <li>For slightly melted butter, place cold butter from the fridge into the microwave on high for 40 seconds.</li>
            <li>Make sure all of the ingredients are at room temperature; this will help them to combine more easily.</li>
            <li>Do not overmix the cupcake batter; otherwise, you’ll end up with tough cupcakes.</li>
            <li>Don’t overfill the cupcake liners or the cupcakes won’t rise properly.</li>
            <li>It’s important to remove the cupcakes from the hot cupcake tins as soon as they come out of the oven so they don’t continue baking and dry out.
            </li>
            <li>If you don’t have a piping tip set, place the frosting in a Ziplock bag and cut the corner off to allow you to pipe the frosting.</li>
            <li>Ganache-filled cupcakes shouldn’t be left at room temperature longer than 2 days before refrigerating.</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <div class="lists">
        <ul>
        <h3>For the Cupcakes</h3>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350°F. Line 12-count cupcake tins with 20 cupcake liners.</li>
            <li>In a medium bowl, whisk the flour, unsweetened cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Place butter and chocolate chips in a large microwave-safe bowl. Heat in microwave (on high) for 1 minute, then stir well. If not fully melted, continue to heat and stir well in 30-second intervals until melted. This should be melted but not very hot.</li>
            <li>Stir (with a mixing spoon, not electric beaters) the brown sugar into the melted chocolate mixture.</li>
            <li>Whisk the eggs and vanilla into the melted chocolate mixture.</li>
            <img src="../../images/Halloween Graveyard Cupcakes/8.png" class="recipe">
            <li>Pour half of the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients and stir just until combined. Do not overmix.</li>
            <img src="../../images/Halloween Graveyard Cupcakes/9.png" class="recipe">
            <li>Stir all the buttermilk into the wet mixture. Stir just until mixed.</li>
            <li>Pour the remaining half of the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients and stir just until mixed and no white flour remains. Don’t overmix or the cupcakes won’t bake into the correct soft texture.</li>
            <img src="../../images/Halloween Graveyard Cupcakes/10.png" class="recipe">
            <li>Fill the cupcake liners halfway full with cupcake batter. This will be 20 cupcakes. Don’t overfill cupcake liners or the cupcakes won’t rise properly.</li>
            <img src="../../images/Halloween Graveyard Cupcakes/11.png" class="recipe">
            <li>Place cupcakes into the oven and bake for 15-16 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the middle comes out clean.</li>
            <li>Remove the cupcakes from the hot cupcake tins and place them on a wire rack to cool completely before frosting. It’s important to remove the cupcakes from the hot cupcake tin as soon as they come out of the oven so they don’t continue baking and dry out.</li>
            <img src="../../images/Halloween Graveyard Cupcakes/12.png" class="recipe">
        <h3>For the Ganache</h3>
            <li>While the cupcakes cool, make the ganache: In a medium microwave-safe bowl, heat the heavy cream in the microwave until hot, about 1½ minutes.</li>
            <li>Immediately pour the chocolate chips into the hot heavy cream, then let sit for 5 minutes before stirring.</li>
            <li>After 5 minutes, stir chocolate chips and heavy cream until well mixed.</li>
            <li>Stir in the corn syrup.</li>
            <li>Set the bowl in the refrigerator to chill for 30 minutes before using it to fill cupcakes.</li>
            <img src="../../images/Halloween Graveyard Cupcakes/13.png" class="recipe">
        <h3>For the Frosting</h3>
            <li>While the ganache chills, make the frosting: In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat the powdered sugar, butter, unsweetened cocoa powder, and vanilla extract on high until the frosting is light and fluffy, about 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the frosting to a large icing bag with or without an icing tip (I used a Wilton 1M tip for these cupcakes).</li>
            <li>Set frosting aside for now. This can stay out at room temperature.</li>
            <img src="../../images/Halloween Graveyard Cupcakes/14.png" class="recipe">
        <h3>For Decorating</h3>
            <li>In a small microwave-safe bowl, melt the white chocolate in the microwave just until melted (start with 30 seconds on high then stir – you don’t want this really hot).</li>
            <li>Place the melted white chocolate into an icing bag and cut a very small hole at the tip for printing.</li>
            <img src="../../images/Halloween Graveyard Cupcakes/15.png" class="recipe">
            <li>Print funny and clever sayings on the chocolate rectangle “tombstone” cookies. Some examples include: RIP, Ima Goner, Game Over, This Sucks, One Way, Dead End, Bea Fraid, Ben Better.</li>
            <li>Place the printed-on cookies into the freezer for about 5-10 minutes just so the white chocolate hardens before putting them on top of the cupcakes.</li>
            <li>To fill the cupcakes with ganache, use a small knife to cut a small hole (well) into the top of each cupcake. Spoon about a teaspoon of ganache into each cupcake then place the cut circle of cupcake back on top to cover the ganache filling.</li>
            <img src="../../images/Halloween Graveyard Cupcakes/16.png" class="recipe">
            <li>Pipe frosting on top of each filled cupcake then place a tombstone cookie in the top of each.</li>
