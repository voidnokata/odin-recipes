    <h2>Tips for the Best Peanut Butter Pie</h2>
    <div class="lists">
        <ul>
            <li>Allow the pie crust to cool completely before adding in the filling. If the pie crust is still warm, it will hurt the integrity of the peanut butter filling.
            </li>
            <li>Scrap down the sides of the bowl when mixing your ingredients together. You want to make sure that everything is fully incorporated before adding it to the pie crust.
            </li>
            <li>This pie does need time to firm up in the fridge. Make sure you allow it at least 2 hours before slicing. You can make it the night before and keep it in the fridge until it’s time to enjoy.</li>
