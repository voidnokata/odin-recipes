    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice</li>
        <li>1 cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>3 large eggs</li>
        <li>2/3 cup canned pumpkin (or homemade pumpkin puree)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Filling</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>8 ounces cream cheese , softened</li>
        <li>2 Tablespoons butter , softened</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 cup powdered sugar , plus more for dusting</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>GFirst, line the bottom of the pan with parchment paper, leaving a little overhang on the long edges, so that it’s easier to lift the cake from the pan when it’s done baking.</li>
        <li>Next, spread the cake batter on top of the parchment paper in the pan and smooth it into an even layer.  Bake it for about 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Combine sugar, butter, and water in a medium saucepan; cook and stir over medium heat until boiling. Remove from heat and stir in chocolate chips until melted and smooth; mix in eggs and vanilla. Combine flour, salt, and baking soda; stir into the chocolate mixture. Spread brownie batter evenly into the prepared pan.</li>

        <li>When the cake is finished baking, carefully lift the cake from the pan and roll the hot cake up inside the parchment paper. This method is SOO much easier than turning it out onto a towel and praying that it doesn’t crack, or stick to the towel.</li>
        <img src="../images/Pumpkin roll/Pumpkin2.jpg">
        <li>Allow the cake to cool completely, rolled up in the parchment paper, on top of a wire cooling rack. Once it’s cool unroll the pumpkin roll and discard the parchment paper.  Spread the cream cheese filling all over the top of the pumpkin roll and roll it back up into a log (without the parchment paper).</li>
